/**
 The `EKEnumerable` protocol and mixin provide a number of methods for
 traversing, searching and sorting collection classes. To include the
 `EKEnumerable` mixin, collection classes need to:

 1. Adopt the `EKEnumerable` protocol

 2. Implement `+load` and call `[self includeEKEnumerable]`

 3. Implement `-each:` to traverse the collection, applying the block
    to each element.

 For example:

    // MyCollection.h
    @interface MyCollection : NSObject <EKEnumerable>

    @end

    // MyCollection.m
    @implementation

    + (void)load
    {
        [self includeEKEnumerable];
    }

    - (instancetype)each:(void (^)(id))block
    {
        for (id obj in self.data) {
            block(obj);
        }
        return self;
    }

    @end

 Collection classes must implement this method to traverse each element

 `mapDictionary:` behaves just like `map:` except that it returns an

    NSDictionary *grape = @{ @"id": @2, @"name": @"Grape", @"grows_on": @"vine" };

 **Note:** If the block returns a key that already exists in the
 dictionary (i.e., if two elements return the same key while iterating),
 the last value for that key will end up in the resulting dictionary.
 Later values in the enumeration for the same key will replace earlier
 values for that key.

 @param block A block that maps objects to entries. The dictionary returned

/**
 Applies the block to each item in the collection, using the result as
 the item's key. Returns an array of pairs of the form

    @[ key, @[first match, second match] ]

 This method behaves like `groupBy:`, except the original order of the
 items is unchanged (this is particularly useful if the original collection
 is sorted).

 For example, with the array `@[@"foo", @"bar"]`, if we were to chunk by
 each item's first character:

    [@[@"foo", @"bar"] chunk:^(id string){
        return [string substringToIndex:1];
    }];
    // => @[
            @[@"f", @[@"foo"]],
            @[@"b", @[@"bar"]]
          ]

 Every "chunk" of items that returns the same value from the block is
 grouped together:

    [@[@"foo", @"bar", @"baz"] chunk:^(id string){
        return [string substringToIndex:1];
    }];
    // => @[
            @[@"f", @[@"foo"]],
            @[@"b", @[@"bar", @"baz"]]
          ]

 @param block A block whose return value will be used as a key to group
    the item by.

/**
 Accumulates a result by applying the block to each element in turn.
 Each time the block is executed, its return value becomes the new value
 of the accumulator.

 In this form of `reduce:`, as opposed to `reduce:withBlock:`, the first
 element of the collection will become the initial value of the
 accumulator, and every other element in the collection will be passed
 to the block in turn.

 For example, take an array of numbers for which we need to calculate
 the maximum:

    NSArray *numbers = @[@5, @1, @100, @13, @28, @123, @321, @10, @99, @4];

    // at each step, returns the new maximum
    [numbers reduce:^(id max, id num){
        return [num integerValue] > [max integerValue] ? num : max;
    }];
    // => @321

 1. The first element, `@5`, becomes the first value of `max`
 2. The block is called with `max = @5` and `num = @1`. `max` is still
    greater, so it is returned.
 3. The block is called with `max = @5` and `num = @100`. This time,
    `num` is greater, and so the block returns `@100`.
 4. The block is called with `max = @100` and `num = @13`. It returns
    `@100`.
 5. And so on, until the maximum value of `@321` is returned.

 @param block A block that accepts an accumulator value, and each
    successive object in the collection.

 @return The result of the transformation.
 */
- (id)reduce:(id (^)(id memo, id obj))block;

/**
 Accumulates a result by applying the block to each element in turn.
 Each time the block is executed, its return value becomes the new value
 of the accumulator. The final result may be a new collection or a
 discrete object.

 In a variation on the example in `reduce:`, instead of returning the
 maximum value in the array, we can instead return an array showing
 how the maximum value changed across the enumeration:

    NSArray *numbers = @[@5, @1, @100, @13, @28, @123, @321, @10, @99, @4];

    [numbers reduce:[numbers take:1] withBlock:^(id maximums, id num){
        if ([num integerValue] > [[maximums lastObject] integerValue]) {
            [maximums addObject:num];
        }
        return maximums;
    }];
    // => @[@5, @100, @123, @321]

 1. We use `[numbers take:1]` as the initial, which returns a new array
    containing the first number (`@[@5]`). At each step, we test if the
    number is greater than the last object in the array (the current
    maximum).
 2. For the first and second iterations, `maximums` is unchanged, as the
    max value hasn't increased yet.
 3. For `num = @100`, we have a new max value, so it is added to the
    array.
 4. And so on, until the final array of maximum numbers is copied and
    returned.

 @param initial The initial accumulator value to be passed to the block.
    If the object conforms to `NSMutableCopying`, a mutable copy of it
    will be taken, to allow for the construction of new collections.
    Passing `nil` causes the first element to become the initial value,
    and thus is equivalent to calling `reduce:`.

 @param block A block that accepts an accumulator value, and each
    successive object in the collection.

 @return The result of the transformation. This may be a new collection,
    or a discrete object. If the result conforms to `NSCopying`, it is
    copied first.
